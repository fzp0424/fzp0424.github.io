Hello! I am a master's student at Zhejiang University, where I am advised by Prof. [Zuozhu Liu (刘佐珠)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lzz) and expect to graduate in 2026. My research focuses on Large Language Models, specifically in areas like Reinforcement Learning, Post-training, Agent, and their applications in Machine Translation.

I am actively seeking a PhD position for Fall 2026 and am also enthusiastic about internship and full-time opportunities in the industry. I am driven by a desire to pursue research directions that are both general and impactful.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Automation from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ). As an undergraduate, I had the valuable opportunity to be a research intern at the City University of Hong Kong under the guidance of Prof. [Shiqi Wang (王诗淇)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pr7s2VUAAAAJ) . I've also been fortunate to gain industry experience at *Alibaba* and *Xiaohongshu*, and to collaborate with incredible mentors like [Yu Cao (曹宇)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lcTd7rkAAAAJ) , and [Shaosheng Cao  (曹绍升)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZF0ntl4AAAAJ). I have also worked with [Yan Zhang (张琰)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-oIMVnUAAAAJ) and  [Baoliang Chen (陈宝亮)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=w_WL27oAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW), whose guidance has been invaluable.

My research has led to several publications at top-tier AI conferences, including ACL , EMNLP , and NAACL.

I am a strong believer in knowledge sharing. I previously co-operated the [DLNLP community](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xWNbeKWQRqmS3YYLRQzP2A), which grew to over 100,000 subscribers. In 2024, I started my own academic paper-sharing account on Xiaohongshu (Rednote), "[nlper今天读paper了吗](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/62137b1f00000000100047e9?xsec_token=YBHot9aBAvQBmxHnrPsWAi6jCkjsr-WUfR3x_zTQEtMGA%3D&xsec_source=app_share&xhsshare=CopyLink&appuid=62137b1f00000000100047e9&apptime=1750169103&share_id=20e9d8d3455143cf937a8135a006ce4e&share_channel=copy_link)", which has quickly grown to a community of over 13,000 followers.

Outside of research, I stay active and energized through sports. I'm a certified National Level 2 Basketball Referee🏀, a fitness enthusiast🎽, a runner👟, and a former competitive rower🚣.
